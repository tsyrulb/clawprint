## Prerequisites

- **Rust toolchain** (1.80+) — install from https://rustup.rs
- **OpenClaw** (for live recording) — install from https://openclaw.bot or `npm install -g openclaw@latest`. Requires Node.js 22+.
- A browser (for the web dashboard)

## Installation

### Prebuilt binaries (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsyrulb/clawprint/master/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest release binary for your platform (Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS Intel/Apple Silicon) and installs it to `~/.local/bin/`. Falls back to building from source if no prebuilt binary is available.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsyrulb/clawprint.git
cd clawprint
cargo build --release
```

The binary is at `./target/release/clawprint`. You can copy it to your PATH:

```bash
cp ./target/release/clawprint ~/.local/bin/
```

### Using cargo install

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

### Verify installation

```bash
clawprint --version
clawprint --help
```

---

## Using Clawprint with OpenClaw (End-to-End)

This section walks through the complete workflow: installing OpenClaw, starting the gateway, recording a live agent session with Clawprint, and then analysing the results.

### Step 1: Install OpenClaw

If you don't have OpenClaw yet:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.bot/install.sh | bash

# or via npm
npm install -g openclaw@latest
```

Requirements: Node.js 22+. On Windows, use WSL2.

After installing, run the onboarding wizard:

```bash
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

This sets up your config at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`, configures authentication, and optionally installs the background daemon.

### Step 2: Start the OpenClaw gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway
```

The gateway starts on `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` by default. Verify it's running:

```bash
openclaw status
```

You should see the gateway as active. The gateway dashboard is also available at `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` in your browser.

If you need a different port:

```bash
openclaw gateway --port 19000
```

### Step 3: Find your auth token

Clawprint needs the gateway auth token to connect. It's in your OpenClaw config:

```bash
cat ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json | grep -A2 '"auth"'
```

Look for the `gateway.auth.token` field. Clawprint auto-discovers this file, so if it exists you don't need to do anything extra.

If you can't find the token, you can pass it explicitly when recording (see Step 5).

### Step 4: Build Clawprint

```bash
cd clawprint
cargo build --release
```

### Step 5: Start recording

Open a **first terminal** and start Clawprint:

```bash
./target/release/clawprint record \
  --gateway ws://127.0.0.1:18789 \
  --out ./clawprints
```

You'll see a live spinner:

```
  [00:00:05] 12 events captured | Last: AGENT_EVENT
```

If you get "No auth token found", either:
- Check that `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` has `gateway.auth.token`, or
- Pass it explicitly: `--token your-token-here`

### Step 6: Use OpenClaw normally

Open a **second terminal** (or use any OpenClaw client — CLI, web chat, mobile app, etc.) and interact with your agent:

```bash
# Send a message to the agent
openclaw agent --message "Read the file README.md and summarise it"

# Or start an interactive session
openclaw agent
```

Everything the agent does — reading files, running commands, generating responses — flows through the gateway and Clawprint records it all in real time.

You can also use other OpenClaw interfaces (WhatsApp, Telegram, web dashboard, etc.) — Clawprint captures events from all connected clients.

### Step 7: Stop recording

Go back to the **first terminal** (where Clawprint is running) and press **Ctrl+C**.

Clawprint will flush remaining events, compute the root hash, and write the final metadata:

```
  Recording saved: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
```

### Step 8: Explore the recording

Now use Clawprint's analysis tools:

```bash
# List all recordings
./target/release/clawprint list --out ./clawprints

# Check integrity
./target/release/clawprint verify --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints

# View statistics
./target/release/clawprint stats --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints

# Replay offline
./target/release/clawprint replay --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints --offline

# Open web dashboard
./target/release/clawprint view --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints --open
```

### Step 9: Compare runs (optional)

Record a second session, then diff them:

```bash
./target/release/clawprint diff \
  --run-a <first_run_id> \
  --run-b <second_run_id> \
  --out ./clawprints
```

### Typical workflow summary

```
Terminal 1                          Terminal 2
──────────────────────────          ──────────────────────────
openclaw gateway                    (gateway running)

clawprint record --out ./clawprints
  ... spinner shows events ...      openclaw agent --message "do something"
                                    openclaw agent --message "now do this"
                                    openclaw agent --message "one more task"
  Ctrl+C
  Recording saved: abc123...

clawprint list --out ./clawprints
clawprint stats --run abc123 --out ./clawprints
clawprint view  --run abc123 --out ./clawprints --open
```

### Running on a remote server

If OpenClaw runs on a different machine:

```bash
# On the server, start gateway bound to its IP (requires --token for security)
openclaw gateway --bind 0.0.0.0 --token my-secret-token

# On your local machine, point Clawprint at the remote gateway
clawprint record \
  --gateway ws://192.168.1.100:18789 \
  --token my-secret-token \
  --out ./clawprints
```

If you use Tailscale/Tailnet:

```bash
openclaw gateway --bind tailnet --token my-secret-token

clawprint record \
  --gateway ws://your-machine.tail1234.ts.net:18789 \
  --token my-secret-token \
  --out ./clawprints
```

### Long-running recording

For continuous monitoring of always-on agents, use **daemon mode** instead:

```bash
clawprint daemon --gateway ws://127.0.0.1:18789 --out ./clawprints
```

Daemon mode writes to a single continuous ledger and auto-reconnects on disconnect. See the [Daemon Mode](#daemon-mode-247-recording) section for systemd setup and details.

---

## Recording Agent Runs

### Step 1: Start OpenClaw

Make sure your OpenClaw instance is running. By default the gateway listens on `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`.

### Step 2: Authentication

Clawprint needs a gateway auth token. It looks for it automatically in:

```
~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

Expected format:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "auth": {
      "token": "your-gateway-token"
    }
  }
}
```

If the file exists and has a token, Clawprint picks it up automatically. Otherwise, pass it manually with `--token`.

### Step 3: Start recording

```bash
clawprint record --gateway ws://127.0.0.1:18789 --out ./clawprints
```

You will see a live spinner showing:
- Elapsed time
- Number of events captured
- Last event type received

Now use OpenClaw normally — have conversations, let the agent use tools, etc. Every event flows through the gateway and Clawprint records it.

### Step 4: Stop recording

Press **Ctrl+C**. Clawprint will:
1. Write a `RUN_END` event
2. Flush all buffered events to SQLite
3. Compute the root hash of the hash chain
4. Write `meta.json` with run metadata

### Recording options

```bash
# Custom run name instead of auto-generated UUID
clawprint record --run-name my-experiment-1

# Disable secret redaction (not recommended for production)
clawprint record --no-redact

# Explicit token
clawprint record --token your-token-here

# Larger batch size for high-throughput recording
clawprint record --batch-size 500

# Custom output directory
clawprint record --out /var/log/clawprints
```

### What gets recorded

Clawprint captures everything flowing through the OpenClaw gateway:

| Event | What it contains |
|-------|-----------------|
| Agent lifecycle | Start/end of each agent conversation, prompts, exit codes |
| Tool usage | Which tools the agent called, arguments passed, results returned |
| Chat output | Streamed assistant messages (delta chunks and final text) |
| Presence | Agent status heartbeats |
| Ticks | Gateway event loop ticks |

All events are chained with SHA-256 hashes, so any modification after recording is detectable.

---

## Browsing Recordings

### List all runs

```bash
clawprint list --out ./clawprints
```

Output shows a table with:
- **Run ID** (first 8 characters)
- **Started** timestamp
- **Duration** (human-readable: "53m 0s")
- **Event count**
- **Storage size**
- Summary footer with totals

### Understanding run IDs

Each run gets a UUID like `78cc70fb-a2eb-4c35-afe1-481d9e1752cf`. Most commands accept either the full UUID or just the first few characters (enough to be unique):

```bash
# These are equivalent if only one run starts with "78cc"
clawprint stats --run 78cc70fb-a2eb-4c35-afe1-481d9e1752cf --out ./clawprints
clawprint stats --run 78cc70fb --out ./clawprints
```

Note: the short form must match a directory name in `./clawprints/runs/`, so use the full ID if the short form doesn't work.

---

## Web Dashboard

The web viewer provides an interactive dark-themed dashboard for exploring recordings.

### Launch

```bash
clawprint view --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser.

### Auto-open in browser

```bash
clawprint view --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints --open
```

### Custom port

```bash
clawprint view --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints --port 3000
```

### Dashboard page (/)

The main page shows:
- **Summary cards** — total runs, total events, total storage used
- **Run list** — each run as a clickable card showing ID, status badge (Complete/In Progress), duration, event count, size, and a lock icon for chain integrity

Click any run to open its detail page.

### Run detail page (/view/:run_id)

The detail page has:

- **Header** — run ID, duration, event count, agent run count, integrity status
- **Event breakdown** — horizontal bar chart showing count per event type
- **Filter buttons** — click event type buttons to show/hide specific kinds (e.g., show only AGENT_EVENT and OUTPUT_CHUNK)
- **Search** — text search across event payloads with 300ms debounce
- **Event list** — paginated (50 per page), each event shows:
  - Color-coded left border by type
  - Timestamp
  - Event kind badge
  - Event ID and hash
  - Collapsible JSON payload (click to expand/collapse)
- **Pagination** — Previous/Next buttons with page numbers

---

## Verifying Integrity

Every event's hash depends on the previous event's hash, forming a chain. If any event is modified, inserted, or deleted, the chain breaks.

```bash
clawprint verify --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints
```

Output:
- **VALID** (green) — all hashes check out, recording is untampered
- **TAMPERED** (red) — hash chain is broken, the recording may have been modified

This is useful for:
- Compliance audits — prove agent actions haven't been altered
- Incident investigation — verify the recording is authentic
- Data integrity checks — detect storage corruption

---

## Run Statistics

```bash
clawprint stats --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints
```

Shows:
- **Event breakdown** — table with count and percentage per event type, with inline bar chart
- **Agent runs** — number of distinct agent conversation sessions
- **Events per minute** — timeline showing activity over the recording duration
- **Storage size** — disk space used by this run

This gives you a quick overview of what happened during the recording without opening the web dashboard.

---

## Replaying Runs Offline

Replay reconstructs what happened during a run from the stored events, without contacting the gateway.

### Print transcript to terminal

```bash
clawprint replay --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints --offline
```

The transcript includes:
- **Summary** — duration, period, event count, tool call count, agent run count
- **Event breakdown** — table of events by type
- **Agent runs** — each agent conversation as a section with:
  - Time range and duration
  - Tool calls with timestamps
  - Assistant chat output (reconstructed from output chunks)
- **All tool calls** — flat list with timestamps and JSON arguments
- **Final output** — the last complete assistant message

### Export to file

```bash
clawprint replay --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints --offline --export report.md
```

This writes the transcript to `report.md` in Markdown format, suitable for sharing or archiving.

---

## Comparing Two Runs

If you have multiple recordings (e.g., before and after a code change), you can compare them:

```bash
clawprint diff --run-a <run_id_1> --run-b <run_id_2> --out ./clawprints
```

Output includes:
- **Event counts** for both runs
- **Event kind comparison** — table showing count per type for each run with delta
- **Structural differences** — events where the kind changed at the same position
- **Length differences** — if runs have different event counts

---

## Exporting Data

### JSON export via web API

While the viewer is running, you can export all events as JSON:

```bash
# Start viewer
clawprint view --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints &

# Export all events
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/runs/<run_id>/export > events.json
```

### Markdown transcript

```bash
clawprint replay --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints --offline --export transcript.md
```

### Direct SQLite access

Each run's data is in a standard SQLite database. You can query it directly:

```bash
sqlite3 ./clawprints/runs/<run_id>/ledger.sqlite \
  "SELECT event_id, kind, ts FROM events ORDER BY event_id"
```

---

## Querying the REST API

When the viewer is running, these API endpoints are available:

### List all runs

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/runs
```

Returns JSON array of runs with `run_id`, `event_count`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `size`.

### Get run metadata

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/runs/<run_id>/meta
```

### Get run statistics

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/runs/<run_id>/stats
```

Returns `event_breakdown`, `timeline` (events per minute), `agent_run_count`.

### Query events (filtered + paginated)

```bash
# Page 1, 50 events per page
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/runs/<run_id>/events?page=1&per_page=50"

# Filter by event kind
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/runs/<run_id>/events?kind=AGENT_EVENT"

# Search payload text
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/runs/<run_id>/events?search=read_file"

# Combine filters
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/runs/<run_id>/events?kind=AGENT_EVENT&search=tool_use&page=2"
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "events": [...],
  "total": 6061,
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 50,
  "total_pages": 122
}
```

### Export all events

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/runs/<run_id>/export > full_export.json
```

---

## Secret Redaction

By default, Clawprint redacts sensitive data before writing to the ledger. This protects against accidental credential exposure in audit logs.

### What gets redacted

| Pattern | Example | Replaced with |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Bearer tokens | `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbG...` | `Bearer [REDACTED]` |
| Basic auth | `Authorization: Basic dXNlcjp...` | `Basic [REDACTED]` |
| AWS access keys | `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` | `[REDACTED]` |
| GitHub PATs | `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx` | `[REDACTED]` |
| JWTs | `eyJhbGciOiJ...eyJzdWIi...` | `[REDACTED]` |
| Sensitive JSON fields | `"api_key": "sk-..."` | `"api_key": "[REDACTED]"` |

### Disabling redaction

If you need the raw data (e.g., for debugging in a secure environment):

```bash
clawprint record --no-redact
```

This is not recommended for recordings that will be shared or stored long-term.

---

## Daemon Mode (24/7 Recording)

If your OpenClaw agent runs 24/7, use daemon mode instead of `record`. The daemon writes to a single continuous ledger and automatically reconnects if the gateway disconnects.

### Starting the daemon

```bash
clawprint daemon --gateway ws://127.0.0.1:18789 --out ./clawprints
```

The daemon:
- Records to `./clawprints/ledger.sqlite` (one file, grows forever)
- Automatically detects and groups agent conversation runs
- Reconnects with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s... up to 60s) on disconnect
- Flushes buffered events on Ctrl+C / SIGTERM

### Daemon vs Record

| Feature | `daemon` | `record` |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Storage | Single continuous ledger | Per-session SQLite file |
| Reconnect | Auto-reconnect on disconnect | Exits on disconnect |
| Agent runs | Auto-grouped from events | One run per session |
| Use case | 24/7 agents | One-off recordings |

### Running as a systemd service

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/clawprint.service
[Unit]
Description=Clawprint Flight Recorder
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/clawprint daemon \
  --gateway ws://127.0.0.1:18789 \
  --out /var/lib/clawprints
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now clawprint
sudo journalctl -u clawprint -f
```

---

## MCP Server (Claude Desktop)

Clawprint includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, so you can query agent activity directly from Claude Desktop using natural language.

### Setup

1. Make sure `clawprint` is in your PATH (or use the full path in the config)
2. Make sure the daemon is running and writing to a ledger
3. Add to your Claude Desktop config:

**For Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS, or `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on Linux):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clawprint": {
      "command": "clawprint",
      "args": ["mcp", "--out", "/path/to/clawprints"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Code** (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clawprint": {
      "command": "clawprint",
      "args": ["mcp", "--out", "/path/to/clawprints"]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop / Claude Code

### Example queries

Once connected, you can ask Claude natural-language questions about your agent activity:

- **"What's the status of my Clawprint recorder?"** — calls `clawprint_status`
- **"List the agent runs from today"** — calls `clawprint_list_runs` with `since: "today"`
- **"Show me what the latest agent conversation did"** — calls `clawprint_get_run` with `run_id: "latest"`
- **"Search for any database operations"** — calls `clawprint_search` with `query: "database"`
- **"What tools did the agent use in the last 3 hours?"** — calls `clawprint_tool_calls` with `since: "3 hours ago"`
- **"Run a security check on the latest run"** — calls `clawprint_security_check`
- **"Is the recording ledger intact?"** — calls `clawprint_verify`
- **"Show me event statistics for this week"** — calls `clawprint_stats`

### Available MCP tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `clawprint_status` | Recording status: total events, last event time, ledger size, integrity |
| `clawprint_list_runs` | List agent conversation runs with duration, event count, tool call count |
| `clawprint_get_run` | Full transcript of an agent run (tool calls + chat output). Use `run_id='latest'` |
| `clawprint_search` | Full-text search across all event payloads. Supports time and kind filtering |
| `clawprint_tool_calls` | List tool calls with filtering by run ID, time range, or tool name |
| `clawprint_security_check` | Scan for destructive operations, prompt injection, privilege escalation, anomalies |
| `clawprint_verify` | Verify SHA-256 hash chain integrity of the ledger |
| `clawprint_stats` | Event statistics: breakdown by type, timeline, storage size |

### Time filtering

All time-aware tools accept natural language time values:

- `"today"`, `"yesterday"`
- `"3 hours ago"`, `"30 minutes ago"`, `"2 days ago"`
- ISO 8601: `"2026-01-31T12:00:00Z"`
- Date only: `"2026-01-31"`

---

## Security Auditing

Clawprint includes a built-in security scanner that detects suspicious patterns in recorded events. This runs entirely offline against your local ledger data.

### What it detects

| Category | Patterns |
|----------|----------|
| **Destructive Operations** | `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`, `DELETE FROM`, `TRUNCATE`, `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `mkfs.` |
| **Prompt Injection** | "ignore previous instructions", "you are now", "new instructions:", "system prompt:", large base64-encoded blocks |
| **Privilege Escalation** | `sudo`, `chmod 777`, `chown root`, writes to `/etc/`, `/root/`, `/usr/` |
| **External Access** | `curl`/`wget` in tool calls, HTTP/HTTPS URLs in tool arguments |
| **Cost Anomaly** | More than 50 tool calls in a single agent run, more than 100 events per minute |

### Using via MCP (recommended)

Ask Claude: "Run a security check on the latest agent run" or "Scan for any suspicious activity today"

### Using via Rust API

```rust
use clawprint::security::scan_events;

let report = scan_events(&events);
println!("{}", report.to_text());
```

### Severity levels

Findings are ranked: **Critical** > **High** > **Medium** > **Low** > **Info**

The security report shows findings sorted by severity with evidence excerpts from the original event payloads.

## Remote and Cloud Deployment

Clawprint works anywhere OpenClaw runs. This section covers how to install and use Clawprint when OpenClaw is on a different machine — a cloud VPS, Mac Mini, home server, or any remote environment.

### Architecture overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────┘        └─────────────────────────────┘
```

Clawprint connects to the OpenClaw gateway over WebSocket. As long as you can reach the gateway, Clawprint can record from anywhere — same machine, same LAN, or across the internet.

### Option A: Run Clawprint on the same machine as OpenClaw

The simplest setup. SSH into your server, install both tools there:

```bash
# On the remote server
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.bot/install.sh | bash
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
openclaw gateway

# Install Clawprint on the same machine
git clone https://github.com/tsyrulb/clawprint.git
cd clawprint && cargo build --release

# Record locally — gateway is on localhost
./target/release/clawprint record --out ./clawprints
```

To retrieve the recording data afterward:

```bash
# From your local machine, copy recordings via scp
scp -r user@your-server:~/clawprint/clawprints ./clawprints-from-server

# Or use rsync for incremental copies (useful for large recordings)
rsync -avz user@your-server:~/clawprint/clawprints/ ./clawprints/
```

Then analyse locally:

```bash
clawprint list --out ./clawprints
clawprint stats --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints
clawprint view --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints --open
```

### Option B: Record remotely via SSH tunnel

If you want to run Clawprint on your local machine but the gateway is on a remote server (bound to localhost only):

```bash
# Step 1: Open an SSH tunnel (runs in background)
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@your-server &

# Step 2: Record — Clawprint sees the gateway on localhost via the tunnel
clawprint record --gateway ws://127.0.0.1:18789 --out ./clawprints
```

This is secure (traffic goes through SSH) and requires no gateway configuration changes.

### Option C: Expose the gateway on LAN or public IP

If you want Clawprint to connect directly without a tunnel:

```bash
# On the server — bind gateway to all interfaces
openclaw gateway --bind 0.0.0.0

# On your local machine
clawprint record \
  --gateway ws://192.168.1.100:18789 \
  --token your-gateway-token \
  --out ./clawprints
```

**Security note:** Always use `--token` when exposing the gateway beyond localhost. If the server is on the public internet, consider using a firewall to restrict port 18789 to known IPs, or use Tailscale (see below).

### Option D: Tailscale / Tailnet

If both machines are on a Tailscale network:

```bash
# On the server
openclaw gateway --bind tailnet

# On your local machine
clawprint record \
  --gateway ws://your-server.tail12345.ts.net:18789 \
  --token your-gateway-token \
  --out ./clawprints
```

Tailscale handles authentication and encryption, so this is secure without extra setup.

### Option E: Cloud VPS (AWS, Hetzner, DigitalOcean, etc.)

A typical cloud deployment:

```bash
# 1. SSH into your VPS
ssh user@your-vps-ip

# 2. Install OpenClaw
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.bot/install.sh | bash
openclaw onboard --install-daemon

# 3. Install Rust (if not present) and build Clawprint
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env
git clone https://github.com/tsyrulb/clawprint.git
cd clawprint && cargo build --release

# 4. Start gateway and recorder as background services
openclaw gateway &
./target/release/clawprint record --out ./clawprints &

# 5. Use OpenClaw from any client (Telegram, web, CLI on another machine)
# Clawprint records everything automatically
```

### Viewing recordings from a remote server

If the recording data lives on the remote server and you want to use the web dashboard:

```bash
# Option 1: SSH tunnel for the viewer
ssh -N -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 user@your-server &

# On the server
clawprint view --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints --port 8080

# Open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your local browser
```

```bash
# Option 2: Copy data locally and view
scp -r user@your-server:~/clawprint/clawprints/runs/<run_id> ./clawprints/runs/
clawprint view --run <run_id> --out ./clawprints --open
```

```bash
# Option 3: rsync for ongoing sync
rsync -avz user@your-server:~/clawprint/clawprints/ ./clawprints/
clawprint list --out ./clawprints
```

### Storage location on remote servers

Recordings are regular files — a SQLite database and a `meta.json` per run:

```
./clawprints/runs/<run_id>/
├── ledger.sqlite    # All events with hash chain
└── meta.json        # Run metadata (timestamps, event count, root hash)
```

These are self-contained. You can copy a single run directory to any machine and use all Clawprint commands on it. No server connection needed for analysis — everything works offline.

### Continuous monitoring setup

For always-on recording on a server, use a systemd service (see [Long-running recording](#long-running-recording) above) or a simple screen/tmux session:

```bash
# Using tmux
tmux new-session -d -s clawprint \
  './target/release/clawprint record --out /var/log/clawprints'

# Attach later to check status
tmux attach -t clawprint
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No auth token found"

Clawprint can't find a gateway token. Either:
1. Create `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` with the token (see [Authentication](#step-2-authentication))
2. Pass `--token <your-token>` on the command line

### "Connection refused" when recording

The OpenClaw gateway isn't running or is on a different address. Check:
```bash
# Verify gateway is listening
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18789 || echo "Gateway not reachable"

# Use a different address
clawprint record --gateway ws://192.168.1.100:18789
```

### "Run not found"

The run ID doesn't match any directory in the output folder. Check available runs:
```bash
clawprint list --out ./clawprints
ls ./clawprints/runs/
```

### Empty recording (0 events after agent use)

The gateway auth token may be wrong. Try with debug logging:
```bash
RUST_LOG=clawprint=debug clawprint record --gateway ws://127.0.0.1:18789
```

Look for authentication errors or "challenge" responses in the debug output.

### Web viewer shows blank page

Check the browser console for errors. Common causes:
- Wrong run ID in the URL
- The viewer serves on `http://`, not `https://` — some browsers block mixed content

### Hash chain shows TAMPERED

The recording was modified after it was written. Possible causes:
- Manual editing of the SQLite database
- Disk corruption
- File was copied with metadata changes

The recording is still readable, but its integrity can't be guaranteed.

### Debug logging

For any issue, enable debug logging to see what Clawprint is doing:
```bash
RUST_LOG=clawprint=debug clawprint <command> ...
```

This shows WebSocket frames, event processing, hash chain operations, and storage writes.
